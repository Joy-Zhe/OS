## Basic Concepts

+ Maximum CPU utilization(最大CPU利用率) obtained with multiprogramming 
+ CPU–I/O Burst Cycle – Process execution consists of a cycle of CPU execution and I/O wait 
> 进程的执行过程可以分为CPU执行和I/O等待两个阶段，这两个阶段循环交替进行。
+ CPU burst distribution
> 指的是CPU执行任务的时间分布情况，也就是在不同任务中CPU执行时间的统计分布


## CPU Scheduler
+ Selects from among the processes in memory that are ready to execute, and allocates the CPU to one of them
+ CPU scheduling decisions may take place when a process: 
1. Switches from running to waiting state
> 非抢占式，进程主动调用system call，running进入waiting状态
2. Switches from running to ready state 
> 抢占式
3. Switches from waiting to ready 
> 抢占式
4. Terminates
> 非抢占式，主动终止
+ Scheduling under 1 and 4 is nonpreemptive 
+ All other scheduling is preemptive

## Dispatcher
> 负责执行调度算法，进行调度
+ Dispatcher module gives control of the CPU to the process selected by the short-term scheduler; this involves: 
	+ switching context(切换上下文)：寄存器中的信息，进程中打开的文件等等
	+ switching to user mode：回到需要运行进程的用户态
	+ jumping to the proper location in the user program to restart that program
+ Dispatch latency – time it takes for the dispatcher to stop one process and start another running
